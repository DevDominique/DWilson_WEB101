## ✨ What I Learned

> This was my first experience using VS Code, GitHub, and GitHub Pages in tandem. I learned how to:
> - Modularize CSS for maintainability
> - Troubleshoot cloud storage limits by switching to local dev
> - Use version control to safeguard my progress
> - Share a live link with collaborators or teachers  
>  
> It really felt like stepping into my developer shoes for the first time!
